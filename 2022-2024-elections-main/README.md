Forecasting models for the 2022 US midterm elections and 2024 US Presidential election.

The models for the forecasts are (tentatively) going to be some mix of logistic regression, random forests, and XGBoosting. Most diagnostics and summaries should come from logistic regression models, while the remaining two models will serve more towards predictive power rather than explainability.
